# 1Create a dictionary called `person`, it has three properties, `name` which is a string, `age` which is an integer,

}

# 2 Create a function called `change_age` which takes the `person` dictionary and a `number` as arguments, this function changes the age in the dictionary to the `number`.
#  The return value of this function is the updated dictionary.


def change_age(person, number):
    person['age'] = number

# 3 Create a function called `add_hobby` which takes the `person` dictionary and a `hobby` as arguments. This function adds the hobby to the list of `hobbies` inside the person dictionary. The function will return the updated dictionary.


def add_hobby(person, hobby):
    person['hobbies'].append(hobby)
